# Rockflow
[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/rockflow.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/rockflow)

What is rockflow? Well with rockflow you are able to define workflows (yes even parallel workflows) by writing simple small steps and aggregating them in your flow (the bigger picture... you know)

Let's start the tour!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rockflow', '~> 1.0.1'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rockflow

## Usage

To write your own flow you need two ingredients: the **flow** and your **steps** lets start by looking at the flow.

##### Flow
```ruby
# app/workflows/awesome_flow.rb
class AwesomeFlow < Rockflow::Flow
    def setup
        rock RockStep1, conditions: [{pre: -> { payload[:foo].present? }}]
        rock RockStep2, params: {lorem: 'ipsum'}
        rock RockStep3, after: [RockStep1, RockStep2]
    end
end
```
Easy right? Notice that **RockStep1** and **RockStep2** will be executed parallel (so beware of thread safety and stuff). **RockStep3** will only execute if **RockStep1** and **RockStep2** are finished.
Here is a picture.

##### Steps
Look at my steps ... my steps are amazing...
```ruby
# app/steps/rock_step1.rb
class RockStep1 < Rockflow::Step
    def it_up
        puts "Iam RockStep1 and i am adding something to the payload"
        add_payload :a, 2
    end
end
```
```ruby
# app/steps/rock_step2.rb
class RockStep2 < Rockflow::Step
    def it_up
        puts "Iam RockStep2 and i am adding something to the payload"
        puts "And here are my params #{params}"
        add_payload :b, 2
    end
end
```

```ruby
# app/steps/rock_step3.rb
class RockStep3 < Rockflow::Step
     def it_up
        puts "Iam RockStep3 and i am aggregating something from the payload"
        result = payload[:a] + payload[:b]
        puts "Result: #{result}"
    end
end
```
So now i have defined my steps and my flow but how can i execute it? Well simple just use it like this:

```ruby
flow = AwesomeFlow.new
flow.concert! # execute all steps
```

#### Summary
Define your flow by inheriting from **RockFlow::Flow**. Inside your defined flow override the setup method and use the **rock** keyword defined by your step class. Available options for the rock method are at the moment:
- **after** which takes a StepClass or an array of step classes.
- **params** you can specify extra params to be used in a step.
- **conditions** are used to define pre or post conditions for every step.

#### Conditions 
Conditions are used to define pre or post conditions for every step. To finish a step each given pre or post condition must evaluate to true. 
Let me give you an example:
```ruby 
class MyFlow < Rockflow::Flow

  def setup
    rock Step1, conditions: [{pre: -> { false }},
                             {post: -> { true }}]
  end

end

flow = MyFlow.new
flow.concert # => returns false because the pre condition is false
```

After that start writing your steps by inheriting from **RockFlow::Step** and overriding the **it_up** method. Inside of your inherited class you can use following methods.

- add_payload key, value - This method adds data that can be used across your steps inside of your flow
- payload - This method gives you the chance to access your whole payload from your flow.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release` to create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
